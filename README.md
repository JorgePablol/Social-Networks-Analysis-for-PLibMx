# [Data Wrangling](#Table-Of-Contents)
The wrangling was done altogether (twitter and facebook) in a jupyter notebook via google colab, to see the entire document and more in detail comments I added [click](https://github.com/JorgePablol/Data-Analysis-Libertarian-with-Tableau/blob/main/Libertarian_cleaning_github_version.ipynb) if the document don't open reload or download and open it with Google Colab. 


## The wrangling can be divided in 3 simple steps:

### 1. Importing Libraries and declaring the function I will use to create some features on the next functions.

### 2. Dropping useless features
