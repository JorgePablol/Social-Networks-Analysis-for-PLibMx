# Data Wrangling
The entire data cleaning was made on this [notebook](https://github.com/JorgePablol/Social-Networks-Analysis-for-PLibMx/blob/main/Libertarian_cleaning.ipynb) if you are technical maybe this may interest you, the U-MannWhitney test was donde [here](https://github.com/JorgePablol/Social-Networks-Analysis-for-PLibMx/blob/main/Month_Comparison.ipynb)
